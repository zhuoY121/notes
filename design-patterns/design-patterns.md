## The Seven Principles of OOP

- The principle of opening and closing (the most important)
  - Only expand new functions, do not modify original functions
- Liskov Substitution Principle
  - When inheriting, subclasses should not override parent class methods
- Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Program to the interface, not to the implementation
- Single Responsibility Principle
  - A method does only one thing. Control the granularity of classes, decouple objects, and improve their cohesion
- Interface isolation principle
  - Establish a corresponding dedicated interface for each class
- Dimit's Law
  - Only talk to your direct friends, not to "strangers"
- The principle of synthetic reuse
  - Try to use combination or aggregation to achieve association first, and then use inheritance as a principle
